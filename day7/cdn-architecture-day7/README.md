# Day 7: CDN Architecture & Network Optimization

A production-ready CDN simulation system demonstrating geographic routing, cache management, and network optimization strategies.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Implement geographic traffic routing with latency optimization
- Build cache invalidation and management systems
- Design failover mechanisms for high availability
- Optimize network costs through intelligent routing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Three-Tier Design
1. **DNS Layer**: Health monitoring, geographic routing, failover automation
2. **CDN Edge Network**: Regional caches, content invalidation, origin shield
3. **Origin Infrastructure**: Multi-region servers, monitoring, analytics

### Key Components
- **CDN Router**: Geographic routing with distance + load balancing
- **DNS Resolver**: Weighted routing with health checks
- **Metrics Collector**: Real-time performance and cost tracking
- **Security Firewall**: Rate limiting and traffic filtering

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
./start.sh
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
./scripts/docker-build.sh
./scripts/docker-start.sh
```

### Run Demo
```bash
./scripts/demo.sh
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
python backend/tests/test_integration.py
```

## 📚 API Endpoints

- `POST /api/cdn/request` - Simulate CDN request with geographic routing
- `GET /api/cdn/metrics` - Get real-time performance metrics
- `POST /api/cdn/invalidate` - Invalidate cache across regions

## 🏆 Success Criteria

✅ Geographic routing reduces response times by 60%  
✅ Cache hit rate maintains above 80%  
✅ Automatic failover within 30 seconds  
✅ Cost optimization saves 40% on data transfer  
✅ Security rules block malicious traffic  

## 🔧 Configuration

### Edge Node Locations
- US East (New York): Primary for Americas
- US West (San Francisco): Secondary for Americas  
- EU West (London): Primary for Europe/Africa
- AP South (Mumbai): Primary for India/Middle East
- AP East (Tokyo): Primary for Asia/Pacific

### Cache Settings
- Default TTL: 3600 seconds
- Max cache size: 1000 items per node
- LRU eviction policy
- Origin shield protection

## 💡 Real-World Applications

This simulation mirrors production CDN systems like:
- **Cloudflare**: Geographic routing and DDoS protection
- **AWS CloudFront**: Edge locations and origin shield
- **Fastly**: Real-time cache invalidation
- **Akamai**: Performance optimization and security

## 🎓 Assignment Extension

Build video streaming CDN support:
1. Implement adaptive bitrate delivery
2. Add segment-based caching
3. Create bandwidth-aware quality selection
4. Build cache warming strategies

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

- **Response Time**: <200ms globally
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% steady state
- **Availability**: 99.99% with failover
- **Cost Efficiency**: 60% reduction vs direct origin

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11 + aiohttp (async performance)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + modern CSS (responsive design)
- **Testing**: pytest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting

## 📝 Next Steps (Day 8)

Tomorrow we'll integrate this CDN system with GitHub Actions for:
- Automated deployment to edge nodes
- Cache warming strategies
- Performance testing pipelines
- Blue-green deployment patterns
