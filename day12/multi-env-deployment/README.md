# Multi-Environment Deployment Platform

A comprehensive deployment pipeline system with blue-green deployments, canary releases, and feature flag management.

## Features

- **Multi-Environment Pipeline**: Automated promotion through dev → staging → production
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradual rollouts with metric-based progression
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime feature toggles with user targeting
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing and security validation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live deployment metrics and environment health

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the platform
./start.sh

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:8000

# Stop the platform
./stop.sh
```

## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Backend**: FastAPI application with async deployment orchestration
- **Frontend**: React dashboard for monitoring and control
- **Redis**: Feature flag and configuration storage
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment support

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/environments` - Environment status
- `POST /api/deploy` - Trigger deployment
- `GET /api/feature-flags` - Feature flag management
- `GET /api/metrics` - Deployment metrics

## Testing
